# UML diagram generation

Diagrams included here have been generated by the Java UML interpreter from [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com).

They can be regenerated either by obtaining a copy of `plantuml.jar` or by use of the [PlantUML Demo Server](https://plantuml.com/plantuml).

The `pace_framework.svg` diagram was first generated using PlantUML but then modified in inkscape to be clearer and to add the Matlab red box.
